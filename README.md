# OrderOfOps
A program that uses postfix and infix expressions to compute expressions requiring order of operations.

USE CASE:
1) Make sure your mathematical expression has a space between each operator, operand, and parentheses.
2) Create an object of the OrderOfOps class which takes in the expression in its constructor.
3) call .calculate() on the object to evaluate the expression which will return the result.
